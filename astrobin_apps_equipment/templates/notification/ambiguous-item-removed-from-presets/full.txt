    Equipment item "{{ item }}" has been marked as ambiguous by a moderator, and removed from your presets
{% endblocktrans %}.

{% blocktrans trimmed %}
    This happened because "{{ item }}" is not specific enough, and unambiguous variants already exist in the database.
{% endblocktrans %}

{% blocktrans trimmed %}
    New images cannot be associated with this item anymore, but your past images have not been modified.
{% endblocktrans %}

{% blocktrans trimmed %}
    Next time you upload an image that needs "{{ item }}", please select an unambiguous version from the database
    instead, and then feel free to update your affected preset by saving it again.

{% trans "View item" %}
{{ item_url }}

{% blocktrans trimmed %}
    Thank you for your understanding.
