AstroBin is an image hosting website for astrophotographers. The original
production copy is run on https://www.astrobin.com/.

# Architecture overview

## Components

![Architecture overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astrobin/astrobin/master/graphics/astrobin-architecture.png)

AstroBin is composed by several components. The following paragraphs shortly
describes what they are, what they do, and what their relationships are.

### nginx
The proxy server that sits in front of the app and forwards the requests.

### AstroBin app
The actual main app.

### redis
Used as broker and results backend for celery.

### celery beat
The periodic task scheduler. Think of it as a cron daemon.

### celery worker
The background task worker. Background tasks include:
  - sending emails
  - updating the search index
  - doing some performance intensive tasks
  - periodically cleaning up caches

### db
The postgres database that holds all the data.

### cache
The memcache daemon that store transient data for performance reasons.

### search
The Elasticsearch engine that handles the search index. It's accessed by
the AstroBin app directly for queries, and by the celery worker to update
the index.


# Development Environment

You can setup a development environment using Docker.

## Step 1: Clone the code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/astrobin/astrobin.git
cd astrobin
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Step 2: Configure the system

The `docker/astrobin.env` file contains configuration information for
AWS, PayPal, Google Analytics, e-mail service, and others.  The default
settings are sufficient to bring up a full Astrobin site on your
workstation, so you should not need to make any changes here at first.

But to avoid committing your passwords to the repository, remember
to instruct git to ignore changes to this file:

```bash
git update-index --assume-unchanged docker/astrobin.env
```

## Step 3: Setup Docker

[Install Docker](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community),
and make sure you have the latest stable version of [docker-compose](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases)
installed.

## Step 4: Bring up the stack

The `docker-compose-*.yml` files contain all the instructions needed to bring up the
stack, including how to build the `astrobin`, `celery`, and `beat` containers.

You may want to create an alias to reference all the docker-compose files needed in development:

```bash
alias compose="docker-compose \
    -f docker/docker-compose-app.yml \
    -f docker/docker-compose-worker.yml \
    -f docker/docker-compose-scheduler.yml \
    -f docker/docker-compose-local.yml"
```

And then bring up the stack:

```bash
export DOCKER_REGISTRY=astrobin
export ASTROBIN_BUILD=dev
export NGINX_MODE=dev
compose up -d
```

## Step 5: First-time setup

The first time you launch AstroBin (and only the first time), you will find that
it's not quite working yet.  Notably, accessing http://127.0.0.1/ brings up
the site, but without any CSS or javascript.  Also, the django framework
is not yet set up.

These need to be initialized by running the following commands.

The `init.sh` script does some initial django initialization, like creating groups, a superuser,
and the "site" configuration.

```bash
compose run --no-deps --rm astrobin ./scripts/init.sh
```

Then, to make all the static files (CSS, javascript, images, etc.) available to the app, run:

```bash
compose run --no-deps --rm astrobin python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

## Step 6: Ensure services are running

```bash
compose ps
```

This shows you the containers running.  Check the `State` column and make sure
everything is `Up`. If you see `Restarting` or `Exit` that means the container didn't
start up properly on its own, and you may need to do some troubleshooting
in that container.

## Step 7: Login!

AstroBin is running! Visit http://127.0.0.1/accounts/login from your host. You can login with
the following credentials:

    astrobin_dev:astrobin_dev

## Step 8: Debugging server

For debugging purposes, it is recommended that you launch a simple development
server on port 8084, and then access it directly bypassing nginx.

```bash
docker exec -it astrobin python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8084
```

## Resetting to a "from scratch" build

If something goes terribly wrong and you need to start over, or if you just want to validate that
your code works properly with a "clean" build of the site, you will need to reset things.

Most of the "state" is stored in the `docker_postgres-data` volume, which contains the PostgreSQL
database.  So a "lightweight" reset would be to do the following:

```bash
# bring down the stack
compose down

# delete the postgresql volume
docker volume rm docker_postgres-data

# bring the stack back up
compose up -d

# re-initialize django
compose run --no-deps --rm astrobin ./scripts/init.sh
```

But if you *really* want to start from scratch, for example to do a final thorough build and test
of your new code, then you can do a "heavyweight" reset:

```bash
./scripts/docker-reset.sh
```

This script will reset your Astrobin docker environment back to zero, so you can start over
at "step 1" of the build instructions above.

# Development notes

## Which template to edit?

Start in the `urls.py` file -- the `urlpatterns` list contains the routing rules for
the AstroBin site.  For example, if you're going to be editing the Top Picks, note
the URL used in your browser (`/explore/top-picks/`) and then find the URL pattern that
matches it:

```
url(r'^explore/top-picks/$', explore_views.TopPicksView.as_view(), name='top_picks'),
```

This tells you that the Django View you're looking for is `TopPicksView`, in the
`explore_views` module.

```
$ grep "class TopPicksView" * -r
astrobin/views/explore.py:class TopPicksView(ListView):
```

Looking at the `TopPicksView` class, you can see the template associated with it:

```
class TopPicksView(ListView):
    template_name = 'top_picks.html'
```

Django uses a search path when looking for templates.  Some templates might not
be in this git repository, but rather included in 3rd party modules pulled in
during the build process.  So don't panic if you don't see a template referenced
in the code, within the git repository.

In this case, as you might expect, `top_picks.html` is in the standard location for
Django templates:

```
$ find astrobin -name top_picks.html
astrobin/templates/top_picks.html
```

## Localization

If you update one of the Django templates with text content, it needs to be localized.
In a template use the
[`trans` template tag](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/i18n/translation/#specifying-translation-strings-in-template-code)
to translate text.  Note that the template must first `{% load i18n %}` for this to work.
For example, `{% trans "foo" %}`

The translations are stored in `django.po` files.  Grep through these and if you're adding
just short text snippets, there may already be translations available.  If not, the
localization files should be updated (see https://djangobook.com/localization-create-language-files/)

## CSS changes

All primary stylesheets are defined canonically in the 
`astrobin/static/astrobin/scss/*.scss` files. CSS files are generated using the `compass`
 utility automatically, when you perform a `collectstatic`.

After you update the `astrobin.scss` or `astrobin-mobile.scss` file, you should
first `collectstatic`, and then be able to Shift+F5 in your browser to reload
the page with the new CSS (if you're running the development server as noted
above).

For convenience, you can save time by simply generating and copying the
modified style file, e.g.:

```
docker cp astrobin/static/astrobin/scss/astrobin.scss docker_astrobin_1:/media/static/astrobin/scss/
docker exec -it docker_astrobin_1 \
    sass /media/static/astrobin/scss/astrobin.scss /media/static/astrobin/scss/astrobin.css
```

When collecting static files on AWS S3, a hash of their contents will be
automatically added to their filenames, for cache-busting purposes.

## Testing

Before you submit your code for review, you should run tests to ensure that your changes
have not broken anything important.  Run the test script by executing:

```
compose run --no-deps --rm astrobin ./scripts/test.sh
```

# Postgresql

The following indexes are recommended for your Postgresql server (feel free to
ignore this section for small or development installations):

```sql
create index on astrobin_image using btree (uploaded, id);
create index on astrobin_image using btree (moderator_decision, deleted);
create index on actstream_action using btree (timestamp);
create index on toggleproperties_toggleproperty using btree(property_type, content_type_id, object_id);
create index on toggleproperties_toggleproperty using btree(property_type, content_type_id, created_on);
create index object_id_integer_cast on toggleproperties_toggleproperty (cast(toggleproperties_toggleproperty.object_id as int))
create index persistent_messages_message_user_id_read_idx on persistent_messages_message (user_id, read);
create index persistent_messages_message_created_idx on persistent_messages_message (created);
create index on hitcount_hit_count using btree(object_pk, content_type_id);
create index on nested_comments_nestedcomment using btree(deleted, object_id);
 ```

You may want to configure `work_mem` to be your RAM in GB, times 16, divided by
the number of CPUs in your server.

# Note on building the nginx container

```bash
export ENV=prod
docker build -t astrobin/nginx-${ENV} \
    --build-arg ENV=${ENV} \
    -f docker/nginx.${ENV}.dockerfile . \
    && docker push astrobin/nginx-${ENV}
```

# Docker Swarm deployment

To deploy with docker stack:
