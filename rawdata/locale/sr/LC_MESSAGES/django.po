msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You already love AstroBin because of how it keeps your images organized. "
"Thanks to it, you will never have to worry about losing your precious work, "
"nor all the important meta-data associated with it."

msgid "What if we told you now you can do the same with your raw files?"

msgid ""
"Is your <em>astrophotography</em> folder full of thousands of poorly "

"Is it always hard to go back and find the right calibration files in your "
"dark library? Do you just wish that you could backup your raw files "
"somewhere safe?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<strong>AstroBin Raw Data</strong> is the answer! For a very modest price, "
"you can store your whole <strong>raw data library</strong> online, where it "
"will be securely accessible only by you."

"AstroBin will <em>automatically</em> organize your files by reading the "

msgid ""
"You can upload all of them in a matter of a few clicks, and AstroBin will "
"start organizing your data in \"virtual folders\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Forget about having to take care of complicated folder structures in your "
"computer! CCD and DSLR raw files have comprehensive headers: why shouldn't "
