"To improve the accuracy of your plate-solution even further, please upload "
"one of the XISF or FITS files from your data set. Such files normally have "
"date and time headers that will allow AstroBin to calculate solar system "
"body ephemerides and find planets and asteroids in your image (provided you "
"also add location information to it).<br/><br/>For maximum accuracy, it's "
"recommended that you use PixInsight's native and open format XISF. Learn "
"more about XISF here:<br/><br/><a href=\"https://pixinsight.com/xisf/\" "
"target=\"_blank\">https://pixinsight.com/xisf/</a><br/><br/> <strong>Please "
"note:</strong> it's very important that the XISF or FITS file you upload is "
"aligned to your processed image, otherwise the object annotations will not "
"match. To improve your chances at a successful accurate plate-solution, "
"calibrate your file the usual way (dark/bias/flats) but do not stretch it."
