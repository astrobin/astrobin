msgid ""
"No. A free account will let you upload up to 10 images, and partake in all "
"social activities. For unlimited storage, you will need a premium "
"subscription."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<strong>NO!</strong> If you are a premium member, on AstroBin you can upload "
"as many images as you want, and as large as you want. In fact, full size "
"images are encouraged!"
msgstr ""

msgid "AstroBin will accept JPEG, PNG and GIF. Animated GIF is supported too."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Absolutely. There are multiple ways in which AstroBin can store your data "
"very safely. First of all, the images you upload are stored on a highly "
"durable, highly available, redundant backend. The durability of the storage "
"backend is 99.999999999 percent over a given year. This means that if you "
"upload 10,000 images, you can expect to lose one image to data corruption "
"once in 10,000,000 year. The images are duplicated across two different "
"physical servers, for protection against natural disasters."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The actual website, instead, is hosted on a Virtual Machine, so, in case of "
"severe hardware failure, it can be redeployed to a different server in a "
"matter of 15 minutes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, the database that powers AstroBin (in fact, the whole Virtual "
"Machine) is backed up daily. In case of severe data loss, the website will "
"be quickly restored to a snapshot that's never older than 24 hours."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"That said, you should be aware that AstroBin is not a backup service, and "
"although your data is very safe in our hands, we cannot legally take "
"responsibility in the event of loss, however unlikely it is. Always keep a "
"copy of your image on your computer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Nonsense. AstroBin has <strong>not</strong> been made to showcase beautiful "
"image, but to give everybody an opportunity to contribute to a vast and "
"evergrowing effort of centralization and indexing of important data. That 30 "
"minute picture of M31 you took last night between the clouds <em>belongs</"
"em> here! Don't be shy and post it!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On AstroBin you have two places for our images. The Staging Area is where "
"you can upload images that you want to quickly share on forums, mailing "
"lists or social networks. The days of scaling down and compressing your "
"image so you can upload it to a forum for feedback and critique are over! "
"Just upload to AstroBin's Staging Area, and send the link to anyone you "
"want. The image will be visible only to the intended recipients, and won't "
"appear on your profile or AstroBin's home page."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Public Area, instead, is for your finished products. After you have "
"received feedback on your favorite forum, you can promote an image from the "
"Staging Area to the Public Area, and it will appear on your profile. "
"Remember that you can also move images back and forth from one Area to the "
"other as many times as you want!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"AstroBin was born out of the desire to end something that had been going on "
"for too long: the waste of incredible material to the sea of chaos that the "
"Internet can be. For years, fantastic astrophotographs have beeen uploaded "
"to Internet Forums, often with little or no data, or to general purpose "
"image hosting websites, invariably with no data attached."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Such an image would be seen by some people, then quickly forgotten, and "
"reduced to nothing more than a bunch of pixel in the giant wasteland of the "
"Internet."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This should not be allowed to happen. AstroBin is the response: an effort to "
"host, collect, index and categorize the output of the astrophotographers all "
"over the world, so that their precious data would serve a purpose, and have "
"a meaning forever."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<em>AstroBin</em> is just starting out, and this time we can really say that "
"the sky is the limit! Tons of ideas are in the pipeline. As the user base "
"grows, so does the data. Suddenly, things like automated supernovae search "
"become possible: you could simply upload an image of a galaxy, and AstroBin "
"could compare it to pictures of the same galaxy taken previously."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"AstroBin could also recommend subjects for you to image! Knowing your "
"equipment, your location, and comparing what you have imaged to what users "
"similar to you have, AstroBin could suggest your next challenge!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Thanks to the input from the community, more ideas are flowing in and the "
"list get bigger and bigger."

msgstr ""

msgid "Please read the instructions and the example below, they are important!"

msgid ""
"In a wiki-style collaborative effort, we can all work together, a few items "
"at a time, to improve the situation. It's very simple! This is what you need "
"to do:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Make sure both the make and the name are in English."
msgstr ""

msgid "Make sure the make is not written again in the name field."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make sure there are no words other than the simple make and name of the "
"product."
msgstr ""

msgid "Make sure the words are properly capitalized."
msgstr ""

msgid "Here's some good examples:"
msgstr ""

msgid "And here's some bad examples, that need fixing, and why:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The words are not properly capitalized. It should be \"Meade\" and \"LX200\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The word \"Celestron\" appears also in the name of the product. That should "
"just be the name of the model, not the make name too."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"\"sold\" is an information that refers only to a particular user. Gear "
"objects are shared among everyone, in the database. The word \"(sold)\" "
"should be removed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"\"modified\" is an information that refers only to a particular user. Gear "
"objects are shared among everyone, in the database. The word \"(modified)\" "
"should be removed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Obviously, the user who created this mount in the database, has it on a "
"fixed pier. But this doesn't mean that SkyWatcher sells a NEQ-6 that you can "
"only buy on a pier! \"on a fixed pier\" should be removed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The name of the telescope is not written in English, and that is a "
"description, not the actual product name. Here I would assume \"80ED\". "
"Moreover, \"80mm\" is a property of the telescope, not part of its name."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"\"5.4&mu;\" is a property of the CCD, not part of its name. It should be "
"removed. But sometimes a property can be part of the name of the object, "
"because it's such a generic name: for example, Newton 8\" f/6 would be okay, "
"because just \"Newton\" would not be enough."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"\"CS5\" is the version of Photoshop, but the procut name is just \"Photoshop"
"\". \"CS5\" should be removed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Thanks for reading so far. If you are not sure about how to fix a gear item, "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Are you an astrophotographer? Do you like to share the outcome of your hard "
"work with others? As an astrophotographer myself, and a subscriber to "
"numerous Astrophotography forums, I have found that the Internet is lacking "
"a centralized place where astrophotographers can share their work."
msgstr ""

msgid "Well, this is finally over!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<em>AstroBin</em> comes to fill the gap. It's a website built from the "
"ground up by an astrophotographer, and it provides means to people who want "
"to share their astrophotographs."
msgstr ""

msgid "So how is this different from any other image sharing websites?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<em>AstroBin</em> provides a number of features that are tailored "
"specificlly to astrophotography. Here's a quick run down of the main ones:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Dedication to data"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On a general purpose image sharing site, you would upload your image and be "
"done with it. <em>AstroBin</em>, instead, has a user interface specifically "
"designed to enable you to input all the technical data of your image."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<em>AstroBin</em> will autocomplete your input using a vast database: "
"everything from telescopes, CCDs and filters to astronomical objects in many "
"catalogues will show in popup dialogs for easy selection when you start "
"typing their names. <em>AstroBin</em> is connected to the SIMBAD "
"Astronomical Database, which contains over 5 million objects under over 15 "
"million names!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On <em>AstroBin</em>, astronomical subjects have their own page, where you "
"can see the best images of them, and plots and charts showing trends and "
"interesting statistics. There is also a page that shows the most popular "
"subjects organized by month and latitude!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Data is strongly interconnected"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Have you ever wanted to see how your next image is going to look like? On "
"<em>AstroBin</em>, you can search for all images of a certain target that "
"were taken with a certain telescope and a certain CCD or camera. Or a "
"certain filter. How about all the images between 6 and 8 hours of "
"integration? Or with a certain Moon phase? You can do that!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"AstroBin can help you with your next telescope or camera purchase, by "
"searching for gear combinations owned by other users. For instance, you "
"could search for all images taken with a Canon 5D and any apochromatic "
"refractor, or a SBIG ST-8300 with any Richtey-Chretien telescope. Or, if you "
"want, you can search by telescope diameter too!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, all this information is collected in interesting plots, that can "
"help you figure out how some gear items are trending."
msgstr ""

msgid "All the data at a glance"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each image on <em>AstroBin</em> is annotated of all the technical details "
"about its acquisition. Telescopes involved, cameras, mounts, filters, "
"everything is visible at a glance in the Technical Card. Even the Moon age "
"at the time of the acquisition is displayed."
msgstr ""

msgid "More than just an image"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<em>AstroBin</em> will do more than just host a copy of your image: when you "
"upload a photograph, a histogram and a black &amp; white inverted version of "
"the image will be generated on the fly, so it's easier to spot faint "
"nebulosity regions or spiral arms. Images will also be plate solved, and an "
"annotated version will appear on the site. <em>AstroBin</em> will know what "
"are the astronomical objects in your image without you telling!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Protection from theft with automatic watermarking"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<em>AstroBin</em>'s upload wizard will offer you to watermark your image "
"with the text of your choosing. All it takes is a click!"
msgstr ""

msgid "AstroBin supports multiple image revisions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Don't tell me you have never gone back to revise the processing of an image "
"<em>after</em> you had published it. <em>AstroBin</em> embraces this concept "
"and lets you publish several revisions of the same image easily and "
"intuitively! Now it's going to be really easy to tell whether your "
"processing has improved."
msgstr ""

msgid "AstroBin is social!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On <em>AstroBin</em> you can message other astrophotographer, follow them "
"and be notified when they post new images, or perform requests for more data."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can follow gear items or astronomical subjects, and be notified whenever "
"there's a new image from a certain CCD, or telescope, or filter, and so on. "
"Or you can monitor all the new images of a certain galaxy or nebula."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As you have undoubtly realized by now, <em>AstroBin</em> is way more than an "
"image hosting service. It's what the Astrophotography community has needed "
"for a long time. For years, I have seen amazing images scattered all over "
"the Internet: general purpose image hosting sites, forums, personal websites "
"and even temporary places. Some of those images contain data that is too "
"precious to go wasted in a sea of chaos. <em>AstroBin</em> comes to the "
"rescue to provide a home and a central hub for astrophotographers all over "
"the world."
