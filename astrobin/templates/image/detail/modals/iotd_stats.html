                The “AstroBin Image of the Day and Top Picks”, or IOTD/TP, is a long-running system to promote
                beautiful, interesting, peculiar, or otherwise amazing astrophotographs, with a focus on
                technical excellence.

                            Staff members have a lot of images to inspect on a daily basis, and they can dismiss images
                            if they believe they don't meet the requirements for IOTD/TP selection. If an image is
                            dismissed {{_0}} times, it's removed from the process. This streamlines the process and
                            ensures that any bias present in promotions could be overruled by other staff members.
