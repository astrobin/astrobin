            You are on a Free account, and when you delete an image, your upload counter does not decrease
            (unless the image is deleted within 24 hours of uploading it). The Free account is not a way to keep
            your most recent or best 10 images on AstroBin, but a trial period for you to decide whether or not
            a paid subscription is worth it. For more information, please <a href="{{ url }}">click here</a>.
