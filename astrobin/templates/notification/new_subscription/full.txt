    Allow me to jump in and offer a few tips:

    AstroBin subscriptions are valid for 1 year. When a subscription expires, nothing happens to your content.
    Nothing is deleted, hidden, held hostage or anything. In fact, you can leave it up forever even if you
    stop being active as an astrophotographer.

    If at some point you want to upgrade your subscription, simply purchase the new one and then get in touch
    so I can send you a partial refund for the unused time on your previous subscription, or extend the
    expiration date of your new subscription with pro-rated time from your old one.
