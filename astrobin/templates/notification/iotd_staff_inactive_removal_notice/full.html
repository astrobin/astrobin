        While the AstroBin IOTD selection process has a good level of redundancy built into the system, it still relies
        on the members of the staff regularly making selections from their respective queues.

<p>
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
        As you have not been sufficiently active for a significant amount of time, you have been removed from the IOTD
        staff for now.
    {% endblocktrans %}

    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
        This will ensure that potential IOTD or Top Pick candidates don't go unnoticed sitting in the queue of an
        inactive staff member.

        If the reason for your inactivity is temporary, please let us know and we will be happy to reinstate you.
