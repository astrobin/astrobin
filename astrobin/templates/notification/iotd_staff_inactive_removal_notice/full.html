        While the AstroBin IOTD selection process has a good level of redundancy built into the system, it still relies
        on the members of the staff regularly making selections from their respective queues.

<p>
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
        As you have not been active for a significant amount of time, you have been removed from the IOTD staff for now.
    {% endblocktrans %}

    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
        This will ensure that potential IOTD or Top Pick candidates don't go unnoticed sitting in the queue of an
        inactive staff member.
