    You have been insufficiently active as an IOTD Submitter or Reviewer.

    While the AstroBin IOTD selection process has a good level of redundancy built into the system, it still relies
    on the members of the staff regularly making selections from their respective queues.
{% endblocktrans %}

{% blocktrans trimmed %}
    During the last {{min_promotions_days}} days, you have made less than {{min_promotions}} selections, and this is not
    enough to sustain the IOTD/TP process. If this continues, unfortunately you will be automatically removed from the
    staff.

    This will ensure that potential IOTD or Top Pick candidates don't go unnoticed sitting in the queue of an
    inactive staff member.

    Thank you for understanding!
