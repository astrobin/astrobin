        While the AstroBin IOTD selection process has a good level of redundancy built into the system, it still relies
        on the members of the staff regularly making selections from their respective queues.

<p>
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
        During the last {{min_promotions_days}} days, you have made less than {{min_promotions}} selections, and this is
        not enough to sustain the IOTD/TP process. If this continues, unfortunately you will be automatically removed
        from the staff.

        This will ensure that potential IOTD or Top Pick candidates don't go unnoticed sitting in the queue of an
        inactive staff member.
