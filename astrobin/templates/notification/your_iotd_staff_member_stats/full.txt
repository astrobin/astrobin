{% trans "Hey!" %}

{% blocktrans %}
    Every first day of the month, AstroBin sends you a summary of your activities as an IOTD/TP staff member. The entire
     community is undoubtedly grateful for your contribution to the IOTD/TP process, and we hope you will keep doing it
     with the same passion and dedication. Without further ado, here is your most recent activity data.
{% endblocktrans %}

{% trans "Period" %}: {{ stats.period_start }} - {{ stats.period_end }} UTC

{% trans "Active days" %}: {{ stats.active_days }}

{% trans "Promotions" %}: {{ stats.promotions }}
{% blocktrans trimmed %}
    The total number of images you promoted.
{% endblocktrans %}

{% trans "Wasted promotions" %}: {{ stats.wasted_promotions }}
{% blocktrans trimmed %}
    The number of images you promoted, but they did not end up getting an award. Broadly speaking, lower is better.
    However, since your queue features only a subset of the images in the IOTD/TP process, by design, it's normal to
    have wasted promotions.
{% endblocktrans %}

{% trans "Missed TPN promotions" %}: {{ stats.missed_tpn_promotions }}
{% blocktrans trimmed %}
    The number of images you saw in your queue, decided not to promote, but they ended up being awarded Top Pick
    Nomination.
{% endblocktrans %}

    issues.

{% trans "Correct dismissals" %}: {{ stats.correct_dismissals }}

    them exit the IOTD/TP process early.

{% trans "Missed dismissals" %}: {{ stats.missed_dismissals }}
{% blocktrans trimmed %}
    The number of images you saw in your queue, decided not to dismiss, but they ended up being dismissed by other
    staff members. If this number is high, you might want to use the Dismiss button more often.
{% endblocktrans %}

{% trans "Dismissals to TPN" %}: {{ stats.dismissals_to_tpn }}
{% blocktrans trimmed %}
    The number of images you dismissed, but they ended up being awarded Top Pick Nomination. This number should be
    low, as you should only dismiss images with serious and undeniable technical issues.
{% endblocktrans %}

{% trans "Dismissals to TP" %}: {{ stats.dismissals_to_tp }}
{% blocktrans trimmed %}
    The number of images you dismissed, but they ended up being awarded Top Pick.
{% endblocktrans %}
{% blocktrans trimmed %}
    This number should be very low, ideally a zero, as you should only dismiss images with serious and undeniable
    technical issues. If this number is large, you probably misunderstood the Dismiss button and when to use it, or you
    are in severe disagreement with the other staff members, which suggests a misalignment of values that should be
    addressed to avoid detrimental effects on the IOTD/TP process.
{% endblocktrans %}
