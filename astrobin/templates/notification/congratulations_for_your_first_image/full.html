        Allow me to jump in and offer a few tips:

<ul>
    <li>
        {% blocktrans trimmed with PREMIUM_MAX_IMAGES_FREE as max and 'https://welcome.astrobin.com/pricing' as url %}
            AstroBin is a premium service designed to offer exceptional value to its users. If you're currently using a
            free account, you can enjoy {{ max }} upload opportunities before upgrading to unlock even more features.
            For details, please visit our <a href="{{ url }}">pricing page</a>!
        {% endblocktrans %}
    </li>

    <li>
        {% url 'me' as me_url %}
        {% blocktrans trimmed with url=BASE_URL|add:me_url|add:'?staging' %}
            New uploads go to your "staging area", where they are unlisted. You can still share the link to an
            individual image in your staging area, and people with a link will be able to access it, but to make an
            image public and listed on AstroBin, you need to promote it. Visit
            <a href="{{ url }}">your staging area</a>.
        {% endblocktrans %}
    </li>

    <li>
        {% blocktrans trimmed with url="https://welcome.astrobin.com/faq" %}
            If you have any questions, have a look at the <a href="{{ url }}">frequently asked questions</a>.
        {% endblocktrans %}
    </li>

    <li>
        {% url 'contact' as contact_url %}
        {% blocktrans trimmed with url=BASE_URL|add:contact_url %}
            Finally, should you need any support, simply use the <a href="{{ url }}">contact form</a> or send
            an email to <a href="mailto:support@astrobin.com">support@astrobin.com</a>.
