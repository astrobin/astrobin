    You have been inactive as an IOTD Submitter or Reviewer for {{days}} days or more.

    While the AstroBin IOTD selection process has a good level of redundancy built into the system, it still relies
    on the members of the staff regularly making selections from their respective queues.
{% endblocktrans %}

{% blocktrans trimmed %}
    After {{max_inactivity_days}} days of inactivity (counted from the last selection you made in your queue) you
    will be removed from the IOTD staff.
{% endblocktrans %}

{% blocktrans trimmed %}
    This will ensure that potential IOTD or Top Pick candidates don't go unnoticed sitting in the queue of an
    inactive staff member.

    Thank you for understanding!
