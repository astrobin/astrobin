            <h2>{% trans "What is this site?" %}</h2>
            <h4>{% trans "Hey!" %}</h4>
            <p>
            {% blocktrans %}Are you an astrophotographer? Do you like to share the outcome of your hard work with others? As an astrophotographer myself, and a subscriber to numerous Astrophotography forums, I have found that the Internet is lacking a centralized place where astrophotographers can share their work.{% endblocktrans %}
            </p>
            <h4>{% trans "Well, this is finally over!" %}</h4>
            <p>
            {% blocktrans %}<em>AstroBin</em> comes to fill the gap. It's a website built from the ground up by an astrophotographer, and it provides means to people who want to share their astrophotographs.{% endblocktrans %}
            </p>
            <h4>{% trans "So how is this different from any other image sharing websites?" %}</h4>
            <p>
            {% blocktrans %}<em>AstroBin</em> provides a number of features that are tailored specificlly to astrophotography. Here's a quick run down of the main ones:{% endblocktrans %}
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>{% trans "Dedication to data" %}</h4>
                    <p>
                    {% blocktrans %}On a general purpose image sharing site, you would upload your image and be done with it. <em>AstroBin</em>, instead, has a user interface specifically designed to enable you to input all the technical data of your image.{% endblocktrans %}
                    {% blocktrans %}<em>AstroBin</em> will autocomplete your input using a vast database: everything from telescopes, CCDs and filters to astronomical objects in many catalogues will show in popup dialogs for easy selection when you start typing their names. <em>AstroBin</em> is connected to the SIMBAD Astronomical Database, which contains over 5 million objects under over 15 million names!{% endblocktrans %}
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>{% trans "Data is strongly interconnected" %}</h4>
                    <p>
                    {% blocktrans %}Have you ever wanted to see how your next image is going to look like? On <em>AstroBin</em>, you can search for all images of a certain target that were taken with a certain telescope and a certain CCD or camera. Or a certain filter. How about all the images between 6 and 8 hours of integration? Or with a certain Moon phase? You can do that!{% endblocktrans %}
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>{% trans "All the data at a glance" %}</h4>
                    <p>
                    {% blocktrans %}Each image on <em>AstroBin</em> is annotated of all the technical details about its acquisition. Telescopes involved, cameras, mounts, filters, everything is visible at a glance in the Technical Card. Even the Moon age at the time of the acquisition is displayed.{% endblocktrans %}
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>{% trans "More than just an image" %}</h4>
                    <p>
                    {% blocktrans %}<em>AstroBin</em> will do more than just host a copy of your image: when you upload a photograph, a histogram and a black &amp; white inverted version of the image will be generated on the fly, so it's easier to spot faint nebulosity regions or spiral arms. Images will also be plate solved, and an annotated version will appear on the site. <em>AstroBin</em> will know what are the astronomical objects in your image without you telling!{% endblocktrans %}
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>{% trans "AstroBin supports multiple image revisions" %}</h4>
                    <p>
                    {% blocktrans %}Don't tell me you have never gone back to revise the processing of an image <em>after</em> you had published it. <em>AstroBin</em> embraces this concept and lets you publish several revisions of the same image easily and intuitively! Now it's going to be really easy to tell whether your processing has improved.{% endblocktrans %}
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>{% trans "AstroBin is social!" %}</h4>
                    <p>
                    {% blocktrans %}On <em>AstroBin</em> you can message other astrophotographer, follow them and be notified when they post new images, or perform requests for more data. You can also vote on images.{% endblocktrans %}
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            {% blocktrans %}As you have undoubtly realized by now, <em>AstroBin</em> is way more than an image hosting service. It's what the Astrophotography community has needed for a long time. For years, I have seen amazing images scattered all over the Internet: general purpose image hosting sites, forums, personal websites and even temporary places. Some of those images contain data that is too precious to go wasted in a sea of chaos. <em>AstroBin</em> comes to the rescue to provide a home and a central hub for astrophotographers all over the world.{% endblocktrans %}
