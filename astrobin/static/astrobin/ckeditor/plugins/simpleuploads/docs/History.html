			Fix problems in CKEditor 4 if setData is called on the editor<br>
			Use correct URL for upload if it lacks query string parameters.
			</li>
	<li>3.1: 4-May-2013 Adjusted the ACF for IE8 and IE9<br>
			The events have been renamed to "<a href='Install.html#startUpload'>simpleuploads.startUpload</a>" and "<a href='Install.html#endUpload'>simpleuploads.endUpload</a>" and now the startUpload can be used to cancel an upload</li>

	<li>3.2: 1-June-2013 Adjusted the regexp for detection of uploads to take care of systems that lack the status message.<br>
			Added a console warning if the upload url hasn't been set in the configuration of CKEditor.<br>

	<li>3.3.4: 5th-October-2013 New event "<a href='Install.html#finishedUpload'>simpleuploads.finishedUpload</a>" that it's fired after the final element has been inserted into the page (so you can add for example your custom class or modify any other attribute)
	</li>

			<li>If an image is selected, picking a new one will preserve its attributes</li>
			<li>If the selection is in a link, picking a file will change only the href of the link</li>
			<li>If there's some text selected, picking a file will convert it to a link</li>
		</ul>

	<li>4.2.0: 2nd-march-2014<br>

		Based on this event, two new options are available, simpleuploads_convertBmp (removed in 4.5) and simpleuploads_maximumDimensions<br>
		More features (local resizing) will be available in a future release.<br>
