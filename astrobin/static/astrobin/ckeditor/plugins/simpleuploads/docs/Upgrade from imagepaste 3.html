<h1>From Image Paste 3 to Simple Uploads 4</h1>

<p>After far too long with a name that wasn't really descriptive about all its current features, for version 4.0 I've finally renamed the plugin to "simpleuploads"</p>
<p>That means that when you upgrade this very first time you might experience a few hickups, but it should be easy if you pay a little attention. <br>
Also I must recognize that there's a lot of new code (v4 means far more than the rename of the plugin), and that code might have unexpected bugs, so if you're unsure you can wait a few days/weeks to check that I don't publish a new version to polish this version</p>

<p>First of all: backup your setup :-)</p>
<p>Now delete the <code>imagepaste</code> folder from the plugins folder and place the new <code>simpleuploads</code> instead</p>
<p>Just like when you first installed it open your config.js, and in the config.extraPlugins replace <code>imagepaste</code> with <code>simpleuploads</code></p>
<p>If you didn't apply any extra customizations then you're done!. Clear the cache and reload the editor</p>
<p>But you might have used some of the configuration options that the plugin provides, in that case you have to update that code also<br>
The events have been renamed from imagepaste.* to simpleuploads.*, that's easy to fix<br>
The configuration options are also mostly easy, replace config.simpleuploads_* with config.simpleuploads_*, there's only two exceptions: the CSS clases for dragover, I've renamed the "hover" part to just "over", so they become:<br>
	imagepaste_editorhover -&gt; simpleuploads_editorover<br>
	imagepaste_containerhover -&gt; simpleuploads_containerover<br>
</p>
<p>That should take care of almost everything, there's one last item: you might have used the tmp class in your CSS to style the uploads, in that case you must change .ImagePasteTmpWrapper with .SimpleUploadsTmpWrapper</p>
<p>I might provide updated info in <a href="http://alfonsoml.blogspot.com/">my blog</a></p>
