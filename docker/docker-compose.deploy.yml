# We keep two placement groups: "app" is for the main AstroBin app, the thumbnails worker and nginx. They share the
# media volume. Everything else can go anywhere. The following service can be scaled to multiple instances√ñ
# - memcached
# - celery_*
# - astrobin
#
# Everything else should not be scaled beyond 1 or you might incur in unexpected behavior.
